## INTRODUCTION

**Statistics**: collection, processing, analysis, interpretation of numerical data

### 1.1 Why Statistics

1. clearly defined goals for investigation
2. what data to collect & how to collect it
3. apply statistical methods to efficiently extract information
4. interpret information & draw conclusions

### 1.2 Modern Statistics

- games of chance
- political science

**descriptive statistics**: numerical descriptions of political units

- e.g. mean, standard deviation, charts

**inferential statistics**: generalizations based on sample data

**frequency/classical approach**: statistical inferences concern fixed but unknown quantities

**Data**

- Discrete VS Continuous
- Quantitative VS Qualitative

###### Collecting Engineering Data

- **retrospective** study: using all or a sample of *historical process data*
- **observational** study: observing/recording quantities of interest of a process/population with minimal disturbance
- **designed** experiment: deliberate/purposeful change in controllable variables

### 1.3 Statistics & Engineering

**engineer**: someone who solves problems of interest to society by efficient application of scientific principles

- refining existing products
- designing new products

**mechanistic model**: built from knowledge of physical mechanisms that relate several variables

**empirical model**: built from engineering/scientific knowledge of phenomenon, but NOT directly developed from theoretical or first-principles understanding of mechanism

**Notes**

- **statistical techniques** are useful for describing/understanding variability (successive observations of a system with different results)
- **statistics** provides a framework for portraying variability & learning about its sources
- **variability**: encountered when a process is too complex to model/control
  - cost/time/resource constraints
  - incomplete knowledge

### 1.4 Role of Scientist & Engineer in QI

**probability**

- % of population meeting a criteria
- chance of any one observation from population meeting some criteria
- **probability models**: helps quantify risks involved in statistical inference

**quality improvement**: make it right the first time; do not stay content with and process/product, continuous improvement.

- **reliability**

### 1.5 Case Study

**X-bar** chart: plotting sample average VS time

### 1.6 Basic Concepts

**unit**: single entity whose characteristics are of interest

**population of units**: complete collection of units about which information is sought

**population**: set of all measurements corresponding to each unit in the entire population of units about which information is sought

- **parameter**: characteristic of population
- **variation**: changes/uncertainty in population

| population               | unit    | variables/characterics     |
| ------------------------ | ------- | -------------------------- |
| All students in a school | student | GPA, credits, majors, etc. |

**sample**: subset of measurements that are actually collected in an investigation

- should randomized to avoid bias
  - random number table
  - random digit dialing
- **statistic**: characteristic of sample

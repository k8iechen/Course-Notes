## CHAPTER 1: CIRCUIT VARIABLES

- linear circuits have no net power
- **power balances**: total power in circuit == 0

### 1.1 Electrical Engineering: Overview

- systems that produce/transmit/measure signals
- 5 major classifications
  - **communication** systems: generate/transmit/distribute information
  - **computer** systems: uses electric signals to process information
  - **control** systems: uses electric signals to regulate processes
  - **power** systems: generate & distribute electric power
  - **signal-processing** systems: acts on electric signals that represent information

###### Circuit Theory

special case of electromagnetic theory; study of static & moving electric charges

1. electrical effects are instantaneous throughout a system (near speed of light)

   **lumped-parameter system**: systems small enough that electrical effects can be assumed simultaneous

   - 1/10 of wavelength; $\lambda=\frac{c}{f}=\frac{3\times108 (m/s)}{frequency (Hz)}$ 

2. net charge on every component in system is zero

3. no magnetic coupling between system components

**electric circuit**: math model that approximates behavior of an actual electric system

### 1.2 SI Units

### 1.3 Circuit Analysis: Overview

**ideal circuit component**: mathematical model of an actual electrical component

**circuit analysis**: uses math techniques to predict behavior of circuit model & its ideal circuit components

**physical prototype**: actual electric system

### 1.4 Voltage & Current

Important Characteristics of Electric Charge

- bipolar
- exists in discrete quantities (integer multiples of electronic charge, 1.6 x 10^19)
- attributed to both separation of charge & charges in motion

**Voltage**: energy per unit charge created by separation
$$
V = \frac{dw}{dq}	\tag{1.4.1}
$$
V: voltage (V), w: energy (J), q: charge (C)

$1C = 6.242 \times 10^{18} charges$

$ 1 V = 1 \frac{J}{C}$

**electric current**: rate of charge flow
$$
I= \frac{dq}{dt}	\tag{1.4.2}
$$
I: current (A), t: time (s)

$1 A = 1 \frac{C}{s}$

- made up of discrete moving electrons; considered as one smooth flowing entity (continuous variable)

### 1.5 Ideal Basic Circuit Element

**ideal basic circuit element**:

1. only two terminals: point of connection to other circuit components
2. described mathematically in terms of current/voltage
3. cannot be subdivided

***passive sign convention**:

- V @ terminal 1 minus V @ terminal 2
- i: charge from terminal 1 to terminal 2

*I-V characteristics (graph) for any unknown device

### 1.6 Power & Energy

**net**: lines with same voltage
$$
P = \frac{dw}{dt} = (\frac{dw}{dq})(\frac{dq}{dt}) = V\times I
$$

P: power (W), v: voltage (V), i: current(A)

1W = 1J/s

Interpreting **algebraic sign of power**: If the power is positive (that is, if p > 0), power is being delivered to the circuit inside the box. If the power is negative (that is, if p < 0), power is being extracted from the circuit inside the box.

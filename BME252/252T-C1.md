## CHAPTER 1: SIGNALS & SYSTEMS

**Signal**: set of data/information

- Mostly functions of time, but applies to other independent variables

**Systems**: entity that processes a set of signals (inputs) to yield another set of signals (outputs)

- Can be hardware or software

###  <u>1.1 Size of Signal</u>

[Def] Number that indicates largeness/strength of entity

- Measure includes amplitude & duration

#### 1.1-1 Signal Energy

- must be finite for a meaningful measure of signal size
- necessary condition
  - $ amplitude\to 0 $ as $ |t|\to \infty $ , else Eq. (1) doesn't converge

Area under signal *x(t)* as a measure of signal size:

- accounts for amplitude & duration
- squared to ensure positive & negatives don't cancel

$$
E_x = \int_{-\infty}^\infty |x(t)|^2 dt \
$$

simplifies for real-valued signal $x(t)$ to $ E_x = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x^2(t) dt \ $.

Notes:

- signal energy depends on signal AND load: 
  - energy dissipated in normalized load of 1 ohm resistor if voltage x(t) were applied across resistor
  - indicative of energy capacity of signal, not actual energy; thus conservation of energy doesn't apply

#### 1.1-2 Signal Power

- time average of the energy

When $ amplitude $ does NOT $ \to 0 $ as $ |t|\to \infty $ , signal energy is infinite. Thus signal power is a more meaningful measure, if it exists:
$$
P_x = \lim_{T\to\infty} \frac{1}{T}\ \int_{-T/2}^{T/2} |x(t)|^2 dt\\
$$
simplifies for real-valued signal $x(t)$ to $P_x = \lim_{T\to\infty} \frac{1}{T}\ \int_{-T/2}^{T/2} x^2(t) dt\\$.

-  mean-square value of $|x(t)|$ 
- $\sqrt{P_x}$ is the root-mean-square value of $x(t)$
